# Personal blog of Ken Fussner

Hello, and welcome to my personal blog (backend), where I intend to share a little bit about myself and the adventures that I endure. 


## Issues and contributing 

I will undoubtedly make a typo or mistake here and there along the way, and that's okay. If you come across something, feel free 
to let me know via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/kenfussner/kenfussner.github.io/issues) or send me a pull request with 
the fix in place. Thank you in advance!
