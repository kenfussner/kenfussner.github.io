A little about Ken...
=====================

**I code by day and not by night; well, at least most of the time...**

I am a _Senior Software Engineer_ at [NAMIC](http://www.namic.org), where I manage our [handful of] internal systems 
used to manage the association and deliver numerous value-added services. This position demands the very best of my 
technical aptitude while also requiring proficient communication with various stakeholders at all levels of knowledge 
and technical ability. 

While my work is very rewarding to me, I live for my faith and my family. I share my devout Catholic faith with my wife 
and 2 girls, with whom I spend most of my time outside of work.

More to come someday soon...
