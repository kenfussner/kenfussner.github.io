Welcome
=======

As I continue my journey of life and career, I once again am compelled 
to [attempt to] establish a better online presence for myself. Past attempts 
have been meager at best, mostly due to lack of thought around what I 
truly wanted to accomplish. Now after working on this on-and-off for a couple
of weeks, I feel as though the attempt is at least a little more thoughtful, 
and the results are undoubtedly a bit more refined. 

Now this post isn't meant to provide much, other than to establish the fact that
the look and feel of this site is likely to change more yet in the near future, 
and I need some content to work with.  So without further adieu...
