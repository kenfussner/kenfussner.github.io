I always enjoy a fresh start, a clean slate to work on, to build up from scratch. There are undoubtedly times when 
this is not such a wise approach; but at times, a fresh start can certainly be a good thing. I must admit that I've 
taken a few attempts in the past at starting a personal blog / portfolio, and I've never been quite satisfied with 
and of them. Recently however, I have felt called to try again with a fresh start, and I must say I'm much more pleased 
with the results than any previous attempts. I finally feel like it reflects the quality of work that I strive to produce 
each and every day. I wouldn't say I'm a perfectionist by any means; however, I can be particular and am detail-oriented, 
so I will often times keep working at something until I am satisfied with it. I think I may finally be satisfied with my 
creation in this website, and hope you find some inspiration and enjoyment from it as well. 

Cheers!
