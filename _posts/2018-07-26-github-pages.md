Here we go [again]. I'm not much of a blogger, and I don't really need an online portfolio to showcase my work or 
abilities. I do, however, enjoy trying out different technologies and resources to see what can be made with them. 
Therefore, when I first came across [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) a few years ago, I just had to try it 
out for use as a personal blog/portfolio. While it was fun and easy to get something up and going, I never kept up 
with it. I had my one and only [initial] blog post, and that was it. The only thing that brought me back was to 
retrieve/update my resume. I recently went to do an update to my resume, and discovered a security vulnerability with 
the current configuration (which at this point was a few years dated); it was time for some TLC. Luckily, updating was 
a breeze and things are running smoothly [again].

Maybe, just maybe, I'll actually put up some content this time around. Stay tuned to see if that's true...
