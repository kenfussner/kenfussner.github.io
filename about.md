My purpose here is mostly to explore the land of [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/pages), which 
is where this site is hosted. It also serves as a mini-repository (<em>diary</em> if you will) to document 
some of the things I've done along the way, as we all forget things and need somewhere to find them. This 
is how you edit. Not too bad...
