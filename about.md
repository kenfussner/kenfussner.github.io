>I code by day and not by night; well, at least most of the time...

I am a Senior Software Engineer at [NAMIC](http://www.namic.org), where I manage our [handful of] internal systems 
used to manage the association and deliver numerous value-added services. This position demands 
the very best of my technical aptitude while also requiring proficient communication with various 
stakeholders at all levels of knowledge and technical ability.

While my work is very rewarding to me, I live for my faith and my family. I share my devout Catholic 
faith with my wife and 2 girls, with whom I spend most of my time outside of work. We're fortunate to 
share many common hobbies, such as cooking/baking/eating, gardening, building things (be it with legos, 
magnatiles, boxes, wood, blankets, ...), getting outdoors, sports, and whatever other adventures we can
conjure up. We are very blessed, and we try to give unto others as much as we can everyday.
