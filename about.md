>Husband. Father. Software Engineer. Humble Servant. 

I am a Senior Software Engineer at [NAMIC](http://www.namic.org), where I lead our small engineering 
team. We maintain a variety of internal systems used to manage our association, as well as numerous 
value-added services that are used both internally and externally. We've steadily been able to overhaul 
and enhance the majority of our systems using .NET Core and Azure resources, bringing consistency and 
better maintainability to our entire codebase.

Outside of work, I occasionally write code, do a side-project, contribute to an OS project, or read up 
on something tech related. Most often, though, I am with my family exploring or having some kind of adventure. 
I enjoy playing sports (and watching them on occasion), traveling, woodworking, cooking/baking, gardening. 
I'm pretty easy-going, so as long as I'm in good company I'm happy. I live by the tenants of my Catholic faith, 
and I try to be kind and spread joy to all I encounter.
