>Husband. Father. Software Engineer. Humble Servant. 

I am a Software Engineering Manager at [NAMIC](http://www.namic.org), where I lead our small engineering 
team. We maintain a variety of internal systems used to manage our association, as well as numerous 
value-added services that are used both internally and externally. We've steadily been able to overhaul 
and enhance the majority of our systems using .NET Core and Azure resources, bringing consistency and 
better maintainability to our entire codebase. These overhauls have also positioned us to resell to other 
associations as a SaaS offering. 

Outside of work, I occasionally write code, do a side-project, contribute to an OS project, or read up 
on something tech related. More often, though, I am with my family exploring or having some kind of adventure. 
I enjoy playing and watching sports, traveling, woodworking, cooking/baking, gardening, and spending time with 
friends. I hear that I'm easy to get along with and am likeable; I simply try to listen and respect each person 
I meet for their unique qualities, and find the good in them. 

If you want to know more about me, just ask. Cheers!
