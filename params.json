While that may make what I do sound superfluous, it is actually quite enjoyable and beneficial in many ways.\r\n  \r\nMy purpose here is mostly to explore the land of [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/pages), which is where this site is hosted. It also serves as a mini-repository (_diary_ if you will) to document some of the things I've done along the way, as we all forget things and need somewhere to find them.\r\n  \r\n Cheers!\r\n Ken",
